This Low Fodmap Tracker app for second reintroduction phase.
I enjoyed building this one out, and adding a backend to this.
It's a fully fuctionaly app with both front end & backend.

It can be put to use right away, basically the user, goes through all the sections
of the fodmap diet, including which categeroy they wish to use, next they add what food they eat, portions, etc, etc.

They than include there symptioms and how they felt, and than lastly add a note, than the apps backend classify if, is a trigger or not.
This is really good alternative to physical tracking your information. It retains the information after logging into the app.

As of now, I am completing if I should add the notes section to be retained in the end product, but keeping it simple to the point,
should allow the user to understand there trigger easier and take action, which is mainly what this app is about.
