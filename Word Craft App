Learning english for non native english esl speakers

intention to be able to use an app to learn few words everyday
to write a creative response, to questions such how was your day, what makes you take on this challenge.
Very simple prompots that non english may sturggle, due to the fact that they don't have system to get feedbacl.

Things I wish to add.

As of noe there is no back end, but there is a feature 
where you can download your prompt and sent it too someone
to get feedback. 

Main thing, intend with this to write the words you learn from daily words, and get 
down to writing, there is also feature to pratice the meaning of the words, but primary intend, 
is to get the words done. It would also be nice to have more **web and mobile app** format of this.

So to iterate, the users learns daily words, pratices them, use the newly aquired knowledge write a prompt
very similar to how we learnt to write. Than after completing the prompt, they are able to download, and sent 
over to someone to get feedback!! But also fact i admit, being able to write by hand is so much stronger, for lots
indivuals I have asbosred in early stages!!.
